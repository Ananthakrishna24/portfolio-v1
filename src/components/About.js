        Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and
        web development. Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building software for an <span className="text-green">advertising agency</span>, a <span className="text-green">start-up</span>, a <span className="text-green">huge
        corporation</span>, and a <span className="text-green">digital product studio</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers at <span className="text-green">Klaviyo</span>. I most enjoy building software in the sweet
        spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've also released
        an <span className="text-green">online video course</span> that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
        searching for <span className="text-green">Korok seeds</span>.
      </p>
